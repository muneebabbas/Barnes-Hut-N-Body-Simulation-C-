The main file of the five parts are named as part1.cpp, part2.cpp and so on.
At the start of these main files, I've written how to execute the part.
part1, part2 and part3 were tested on a mac operating system with latest version of clang.
part4 and part5 were run on Ubuntu 15.10 with gcc version 5.2.1.
Speedups for the part2, part4 and part5 are plotted
